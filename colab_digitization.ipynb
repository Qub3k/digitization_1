In particular, signals are converted from the analogue to digital form. Sometimes, at the same processing stage, visual material acquired is compressed “on-the-fly.” Then, it is stored using one of the popular container formats like MP4 or AVI. This fast, “on-the-fly” compression may not be sufficient for some applications. Thus, further recompression is sometimes necessary (e.g., to fit into predefined streaming bandwidth or satisfy maximum file size requirements).\n","\n","Viewing (i.e., playing) a compressed video requires decompression (most often in real time). Afterwards, moving pictures are transmitted onto a screen (in a digital or, after a conversion, in an analogue form). The processes of digitization and viewing will be performed in the course of this exercise."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"aFVfHxq27CvQ"},"source":["## Purpose\n","The purpose of this exercise is to give you a basic understanding regarding digitization of analogue video signals. An exemplary analogue video signal is a signal recorded with a USB webcam. (Although the analogue version of the video signal is most often not available to the user of the webcam. This is because the signal gets digitized in the webcam itself and sent to the computer in this digital version only.)\n","\n","Below is a list of topics this notebook touches upon:\n","* frame rate of a video,\n","* colour spaces,\n","* picture histogram(s),\n","* edge detection and\n","* barcode recognition.\n","\n","Note that the last two topics actually show examples of digital image processing (and not the digitization process as such). They are here to show you how the digital version of an image can be used to extract various information (that would be difficult to extract from the analogue version of the image)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8kINU4Dy7KGw"},"source":["## Requirements\n","To complete this exercise you will need a computer with an internet connection and, optionally, a camera (if you would like to test algorithms presented here with images of your own).\n","\n","**Importantly, this notebook is known to be working in [the Google Colaboratory platform](https://colab.research.google.com/).

It is a CMOS or a CCD (charge-coupled device) sensor covered by a filter (see Fig. 2). Underneath this filter, there is an array of photosensitive subpixels, which do not have to be even of rectangular shape. Therefore in order to convert the radiometric data to an image detailed information on the sensor geometry must be available for the software algorithm.\n","\n","<html><body><div><center>\n","<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ptl8YS1g5EqjQ7_Y0oK3WL1naqTKkOEf\" width=\"500\">\n","\n","Fig. 1.

It is commonly referred to as a digital negative, as it serves a similar purpose as a traditional film negative. A .jpg or .tiff image produced by the camera is that digital negative processed (developed) on the fly by the camera built-in software. The software most typically conducts a set of automated operations:\n","1. develop the raw image (knowing the physical properties of the sensor),\n","* enhance the resulting image (by applying contrast and colour correction and sharpening),\n","* apply additional correction algorithms (e.g. red-eye reduction),\n","* compress the image to the desired format (lossy .jpg or lossless .tiff)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FbFbOWFmOOsd"},"source":["### What are the benefits of RAW shooting?\n","The most profound and important benefit is that a photographer retains full control of the creation, correction and compression processes. All the adjustments can be made by hand and tuned in order to achieve the desired effect.<br> \n","Moreover, RAW files offer much better input for post-processing, as the state-of-the-art sensors store (digitize) the data at 14 bits per colour per pixel. It means that a raw image can hold 214 shades per colour, meaning 242 total colours. A .jpg file typically saves 8 bits per colour, meaning 28 shades per colour resulting in 224 colours. In short, the RAW format offers better colour fidelity **(18 orders of magnitude greater than .jpg)**, much higher dynamic range (High Dynamic Range imaging will be explained further on) and more data for further corrections.<br>\n","What are the drawbacks of RAW shooting?\n","* The visual quality of an unenhanced RAW file is not satisfying as no corrections are applied,\n","* RAW images are of large size,\n","* RAW images require tedious manual development and correction.

Each photographer usually creates his/her own workflow by adding or removing some of the steps. It is important to sustain the order of the steps, as there is a logic behind them (e.g. sharpening has to be done prior to development).\n","1. **Cropping and straightening** – a selection of a composition of the image\n","<html><body><div><center>\n","<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=18wRyA5FDFnTovss-rfxsa_0ae3M0YICC\" width=\"500\"/>\n","<p>Before and after straightening </p></center></div></body></html>\n","\n","2. **Exposure correction** – done in order to correct for over- or underexposed images. Due to the physical characteristics of the sensor a rule of the thumb is that it is better to shoot under-. rather than, overexposed images as it is easier to compensate for underexposure. The most useful tool is the luminosity histogram. A well-exposed photo covers the whole dynamic range and fills the whole histogram. An under- or overexposed photo shows clipping in (respectively) low or high values.\n","<html><body><div><center>\n","<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1mtBmPzGXFJ2bZQIxpNljrwYL15BOAePe\" width=\"500\"/>\n","<p>A histogram of an underexposed image </p>\n","<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=189mjDgxRqx2B96T7HwAYOishQ5rZAwme\" width=\"500\"/>\n","<p>A histogram of an overexposed image</p>\n","<p>(gray area - total luminosity; red, green and blue curves - luminosity for each RGB channel)</p>\n","<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1i8B-2KZ4hwshZPAJXDEuDU5zA0FMCX-Z\" width=\"500\"/>\n","<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ZqMOJaDyymCdckE8OsBKXco0pK-uf6Aj\" width=\"500\"/>\n","<p>Before and after exposure correction.

Each optical device, including the human eye, has a dynamic range. A dynamic range is a difference measured in EV units between the darkest and brightest part of the image that shows detail. Increase of one EV unit represents a situation where the amount of light is doubled. A human eye and a modern DSLR camera sensor have a dynamic range of approx. 14 EV (called “stops”). It means that we can double the amount of light 14 times between the brightest and darkest part of the image and still see detail.<br>We can control which part of the scene is covered by our EV range by adjusting the shutter speed, aperture or ISO value of the sensor. We, however, cannot increase this range."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"51iDuQX8O_FP"},"source":["### What is HDR?\n","HDR, High Dynamic Range, is a photographing technique, in which a set of images is made with different camera setups.
